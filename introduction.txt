SimpleITK is a simplified programming interface to the algorithms and data structures of the Insight Toolkit (ITK) for
segmentation, registration and advanced image analysis. It supports bindings for multiple programming languages including
C++, Python, R, Java, C#, Lua, Ruby and TCL. Combining SimpleITKâ€™s Python bindings with the Jupyter notebook web application
creates an environment which facilitates collaborative development of biomedical image analysis workflows.
